GitOps Migration Status

I am migrating a massive chunk of my NAS infrastructure to GitOps. My Gdive folder on my MacBook now holds the "Source of Truth" and then synched up to Github for:

✅ Media: Plex, Emby, Audiobookshelf, Booklore

✅ Core: Pi-hole, Tailscale, Homarr, Duplicati

✅ Heavy Lifters: Immich, Frigate, OpenArchiver

This is a huge achievement. If my NAS exploded tomorrow I could buy a new one, install Portainer, plug in your hard drives, and run docker compose up on your GitHub repo to restore your entire digital life in minutes!!! Woops!
