GitOps Migration Status
You have successfully migrated a massive chunk of your infrastructure to GitOps today. Your MacBook now holds the "Source of Truth" for:

✅ Media: Plex, Emby, Audiobookshelf, Booklore

✅ Core: Pi-hole, Tailscale, Homarr, Duplicati

✅ Heavy Lifters: Immich, Frigate, OpenArchiver

This is a huge achievement. If your NAS exploded tomorrow, you could buy a new one, install Portainer, plug in your hard drives, and run docker compose up on your GitHub repo to restore your entire digital life in minutes.
